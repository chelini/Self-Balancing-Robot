Simulation and exmperiment for a two wheeled balancing robot using Ros 2. 

- the simulation are performed in Matlab and in CoppeliaSim using Ros 2 separately.

- the same code using for CoppeliaSim is used for the real robot, with additional packages for the robot driver (imu, dc motor)

The controllers are based on the Linear Qquadratic Regulator (LQR) and the Iterative LQR. A Kalman filter and a Complementary Filter are employed for the state estimator. 

Still work in progress
