Simulation using Matlab and code for the real robot using Ros 2. Additional simulation for testing the Ros 2 code is provide using CoppeliaSim.

This repository provides an implementation of LQR and iLQR for the balance control of the robot.
A Kalman filter is employed for cleaning the process noise and the sensor noise (derived from the IMU). 

Still work in progress
